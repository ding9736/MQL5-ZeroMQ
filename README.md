**MQL5-ZeroMQ** is a feature-complete, high-performance message queue library tailored for MetaTrader 5 (MQL5). It seamlessly integrates the power of the world-renowned ZeroMQ (√òMQ, ZMQ) into the MQL5 environment, providing developers with "sockets on steroids"‚Äîintelligent message pipelines with built-in concurrency patterns that go beyond traditional TCP/UDP.

Whether you need **low-latency, high-throughput** inter-process communication (IPC) between multiple EAs/indicators, want to build complex distributed computing systems (e.g., offloading computationally intensive tasks to external Python/C++ applications), or require real-time, reliable data exchange with external data sources, MQL5-ZeroMQ is your ultimate solution.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Extreme Performance**:
  
  - **Microsecond-Level Latency**: In `inproc` communication, a full request-reply round-trip latency is as low as **~6.18 microseconds**, approaching native function call speed.
  - **Ultra-High Throughput**: Stress tests show that using zero-overhead byte arrays (`uchar[]`) can boost throughput to **50,000+ messages/second**, demonstrating its exceptional capability in data-intensive applications.

- üì° **Classic Concurrency Messaging Patterns**:
  
  - **Request-Reply (REQ/REP)**: For building robust client-server communication with automatic handling of the strict request-and-reply sequence.
  - **Publish-Subscribe (PUB/SUB)**: Implements one-to-many data distribution, ideal for broadcasting market data and trading signals.
  - **Pipeline/Task Distribution (PUSH/PULL)**: For parallel task distribution among multiple worker units, enabling automatic load balancing.
  - **More Advanced Patterns**: Also supports PAIR, ROUTER, DEALER, XPUB/XSUB, etc., to meet complex routing and asynchronous communication needs.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Industrial-Grade Security (Out-of-the-Box)**:
  
  - Built-in powerful **CurveZMQ** encryption protocol. This library **already includes `libsodium.dll`**, allowing you to add enterprise-grade end-to-end encryption to your TCP communications with just a few lines of code, ensuring data security.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Features & Robustness**:
  
  - **Asynchronous I/O (`ZmqPoller`)**: Gracefully manage and listen to multiple socket events simultaneously without complex multi-threaded programming.
  - **Flow Control (HWM)**: Built-in High-Water Mark mechanism automatically handles network back-pressure, preventing memory exhaustion from message backlogs.
  - **Multipart Messages**: Atomically split a single message into multiple frames for transmission, a powerful tool for building protocols and transferring complex data.
  - **Fully Tested**: The entire library is validated by a rigorous test suite with over 80 assertions, covering core functions, advanced features, performance, and error handling to ensure its stability and reliability in a production environment.

## üöÄ Performance Highlight: The Unmatched Advantage of `uchar[]`

Rigorous testing has shown that transferring data directly using byte arrays (`uchar[]`) is over **110%** faster than using the standard `string` type.

| Benchmark                                    | Result                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Latency** - `inproc`                       | **`6.18 ¬µs / round-trip`** |
| **Throughput** - `uchar[]`                   | **`~50,289 messages/sec`** |
| **Throughput** - `string`                    | `~23,892 messages/sec`     |
| **Performance Gain (`uchar[]` vs `string`)** | **`+110.49%`**             |

#### Why is `uchar[]` Faster?

- **Zero Overhead**: In MQL5, `uchar[]` is a contiguous block of bytes in memory. Sending it via `zmq_send()` is essentially a direct memory copy with virtually no extra overhead.
- **Avoids Conversion**: When you send an MQL5 `string`, the library must internally convert it into a UTF-8 encoded byte array that ZeroMQ uses. This process involves additional CPU calculations and temporary memory allocation, which becomes a performance bottleneck during high-frequency sending.

> **‚≠ê The Golden Rule of Performance**
> For performance-sensitive applications (like HFT strategies or market data forwarders), **always use `uchar[]`** for data transfer. You can use MQL5's built-in `StructToCharArray` and `CharArrayToStruct` functions to efficiently serialize your data structures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Configuration

The installation process is very straightforward. Just follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Copy the MQL5 Library Files**

Copy the entire `ZeroMQ` folder (which contains `ZeroMQ.mqh` and the `Core` subfolder) into your MQL5 `Include` directory.

- **Standard Path**:
  
  ```
  C:/Users/<Your Username>/AppData/Roaming/MetaQuotes/Terminal/<Instance ID>/MQL5/Include/
  ```

- **The final directory structure should look like this**:
  
  ```
  MQL5/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Include/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ZeroMQ/              <- Copy this folder here
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZeroMQ.mqh       <- The main header file
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Core/            <- Core modules
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (multiple .mqh files)
  ```

#### **Step 2: Copy the Dependent DLL Files**

Copy the two pre-compiled DLL files, `libzmq.dll` and `libsodium.dll`, into the **`Libraries`** directory of your MetaTrader 5 terminal (**Note**: not the `Include` directory).

> **Note**: `libsodium.dll` is required even if you are not using encryption, as `libzmq.dll` depends on it.

- **Standard Path**:
  
  ```
  C:/Users/<Your Username>/AppData/Roaming/MetaQuotes/Terminal/<Instance ID>/MQL5/Libraries/
  ```

- **Final Directory Structure**:
  
  ```
  MQL5/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Libraries/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libzmq.dll
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libsodium.dll
  ```

#### **Step 3: Enable DLL Imports**

In your MetaTrader 5 terminal, go to **‚ÄúTools -> Options -> Expert Advisors‚Äù** and **check ‚ÄúAllow DLL imports‚Äù**.

#### **Step 4: Reference it in Your Code**

At the beginning of your EA, script, or indicator, simply include the main header file to get started. This path will now perfectly match your directory structure.

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>```

## üí° Definitive API Guide & Examples

### Part 1: Request-Reply (REQ/REP)

This is the most basic client-server pattern. The client sends a request, and the server receives and replies.

#### **Server (`Rep_Server.mq5`)**

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>

void OnStart()
{
    ZmqContext context;
    if(!context.isValid()) return;

    ZmqSocket server(context, ZMQ_SOCKET_REP);
    if(!server.bind("tcp://*:5555")) return;

    Print("Server started on tcp://*:5555...");

    while(!IsStopped())
    {
        string request;
        if(server.recv(request))
        {
            PrintFormat("Received: '%s'. Replying with 'World'", request);
            server.send("World");
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Client (`Req_Client.mq5`)**

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>

void OnStart()
{
    ZmqContext context;
    if(!context.isValid()) return;

    ZmqSocket client(context, ZMQ_SOCKET_REQ);
    if(!client.connect("tcp://localhost:5555")) return;

    Print("Client connected. Sending 'Hello'...");
    client.send("Hello");

    string reply;
    // Set a 5-second timeout for receiving
    client.setReceiveTimeout(5000);
    if(client.recv(reply))
    {
        PrintFormat("Received reply: '%s'", reply);
    }
    else
    {
        Print("Request timed out. Server may not be running.");
    }
}
```

### Part 2: Publish-Subscribe (PUB/SUB)

Used for broadcasting data to multiple subscribers. The publisher doesn't care if there are subscribers; it just sends.

#### **Publisher - Broadcasting Market Ticks (`Publisher.mq5`)**

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>

void OnStart()
{
    ZmqContext context;
    ZmqSocket publisher(context, ZMQ_SOCKET_PUB);
    publisher.bind("tcp://*:5556");
    Print("Market Data Publisher started...");

    MqlTick tick;
    while(!IsStopped())
    {
        if(SymbolInfoTick(_Symbol, tick))
        {
            // Use uchar[] for maximum performance
            uchar tick_data[];
            StructToCharArray(tick, tick_data);

            // The topic is "TICK.EURUSD", and the message body is the byte stream of the tick data
            publisher.send("TICK." + _Symbol, ZMQ_FLAG_SNDMORE);
            publisher.send(tick_data);
        }
        Sleep(1000);
    }
}
```

#### **Subscriber - Receiving EURUSD Ticks (`Subscriber.mq5`)**

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>

void OnStart()
{
    ZmqContext context;
    ZmqSocket subscriber(context, ZMQ_SOCKET_SUB);
    subscriber.connect("tcp://localhost:5556");

    // Key: Subscribe to all topics starting with "TICK.EURUSD"
    subscriber.subscribe("TICK.EURUSD");
    Print("Subscribed to 'TICK.EURUSD'. Waiting for data...");

    // ZMQ connection takes a moment to establish, so wait briefly before looping
    Sleep(100);

    MqlTick received_tick;
    string topic;
    uchar tick_data[];

    while(!IsStopped())
    {
        // First, receive the topic
        if(subscriber.recv(topic, ZMQ_FLAG_NONE))
        {
            // If there's another part, receive the message body
            if(subscriber.getReceiveMore(true))
            {
                subscriber.recv(tick_data);
                CharArrayToStruct(received_tick, tick_data, 0);
                PrintFormat("[%s] Ask: %.5f, Bid: %.5f, Volume: %d", 
                            topic, received_tick.ask, received_tick.bid, (int)received_tick.volume);
            }
        }
    }
}```

### Part 3: High-Performance `uchar[]` Struct Transfer

This is the recommended advanced pattern for production environments, achieving zero-overhead data transfer.

#### **Shared Data Structure (`SharedStructures.mqh`)**

It's recommended to create a shared header file so that both the sender and receiver use the exact same data structure.

```mql5
// In file: MQL5/Include/SharedStructures.mqh
struct StrategyParameters
{
    long     magic_number;
    double   lot_size;
    int      max_slippage_points;
    char     symbol[32]; // Use a fixed-size char array to ensure the struct is serializable
};
```

#### **Sender (`Sender.mq5`)**

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>
#include <SharedStructures.mqh>

void OnStart()
{
    ZmqContext context;
    ZmqSocket pusher(context, ZMQ_SOCKET_PUSH);
    pusher.connect("tcp://localhost:5557");

    // 1. Populate the data structure
    StrategyParameters params;
    params.magic_number = 12345;
    params.lot_size = 0.02;
    params.max_slippage_points = 30;
    StringToCharArray("EURUSD", params.symbol);

    // 2. Serialize to a byte array
    uchar buffer[];
    StructToCharArray(params, buffer);

    // 3. Send the raw bytes
    if(pusher.send(buffer))
    {
        Print("Sent strategy parameters successfully.");
    }
}
```

#### **Receiver (`Receiver.mq5`)**

```mql5
#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>
#include <SharedStructures.mqh>

void OnStart()
{
    ZmqContext context;
    ZmqSocket puller(context, ZMQ_SOCKET_PULL);
    puller.bind("tcp://*:5557");
    Print("Receiver listening...");

    uchar buffer[];
    // Set a 10-second timeout
    puller.setReceiveTimeout(10000); 

    if(puller.recv(buffer))
    {
        // 1. Receive the raw bytes
        StrategyParameters params;

        // 2. Deserialize back into the data structure
        if(CharArrayToStruct(params, buffer, 0))
        {
            // 3. Use the data
            PrintFormat("Received Parameters: Magic=%d, Lot=%.2f, Symbol=%s",
                        params.magic_number, params.lot_size, CharArrayToString(params.symbol));
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Print("Timed out waiting for parameters.");
    }
}
```
